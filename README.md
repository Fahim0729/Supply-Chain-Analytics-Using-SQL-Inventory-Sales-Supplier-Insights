## 📊 Database Schema

The `SQL_Portfolio` database was created with five tables to address the business questions of the electronics company:

| **Dimension Tables** | **Fact Tables** |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| • product | • received_purchase_orders |
| • suppliers | • stock_level |
| • datetime | |

### 📈 Data Generation Plan
All tables, except the datetime table, were populated from the staging database, where four external Excel files related to product, suppliers, received_orders, and stock_level had been previously uploaded. The datetime table was created using a SQL script that generates dates from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.

*The following figure depicts the database tables along with the data generation plan used to populate them.*

## 📋 Business Questions & SQL Functions

The questions have been solved using SQL queries, and the SQL functions applied to solve them are listed below:

### 📌 Q1. Brand Inventory Value Analysis
**Identify brands with significant restocking activity (>50 units) in the second half of 2025 (July-December) and analyze their average shelf inventory value to optimize supply chain planning for next year.**

🔹 SQL Functions: SUM(), AVG(), JOIN, BETWEEN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING

### 📌 Q2. Product Sales Velocity
**Identify the top 5 products by total quantity sold and categorize them as High, Medium, or Low velocity to understand sales performance trends.**

🔹 SQL Functions: CTEs, JOIN, RANK(), ORDER BY, CASE

### 📌 Q3. Supplier Restocking Trend Analysis
**Identify the top 3 suppliers with the largest positive change in received quantity by comparing their most recent delivery to their previous delivery, to understand suppliers with significant restocking trends.**

🔹 SQL Functions: Subquery, JOIN, LAG, ROW_NUMBER, RANK, ROUND, Filtering Logic
