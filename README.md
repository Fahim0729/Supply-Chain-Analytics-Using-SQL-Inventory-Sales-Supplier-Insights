## Supply Chain Insights: Product Performance, Brand Value, Supplier Trends

### This project presents an end-to-end SQL analysis for an electronics company, using poducts, inventory, and suppliers datasets to address three key business questions related to stock management and sales performance.

#### SQL Functions & Features Used: SUM(), AVG(), JOIN(), WHERE(), BETWEEN(), GROUP BY(), HAVING(), CTEs, RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), LAG(), ORDER BY(), CASE, Subquery, ROUND(), and filtering logic

The SQL_Portfolio database was created with five tables to address the business questions of the electronics company. Among these, three are dimension tables — product, suppliers, and datetime — and two are fact tables — received_purchase_orders and stock_level. All tables, except the datetime table, were populated from the staging database, where four external Excel files related to product, suppliers, received_orders, and stock_level had been previously uploaded. The datetime table was created using a SQL script that generates dates from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.

The follwoing figure depicts the database tables along with the data generation plan used to populate them.

The next figure presents the database diagram, illustrating the relationships between the fact table and the dimension tables.

### The questions have been solved using SQL queries, and the SQL functions applied to solve them are listed below
#### Q1. Identify brands with significant restocking activity (>50 units) in the second half of 2025 (July-December) and analyze their average shelf inventory value to optimize supply chain planning for next year.
SQL Aggregate and Filtering Functions : SUM(), AVG(), JOIN, BETWEEN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING 

#### Q2. Identify the top 5 products by total quantity sold and categorize them as High, Medium, or Low velocity to understand sales performance trends.
SQL CTEs with Ranking and Conditional Logic: CTEs, JOIN, RANK(), ORDER BY, CASE

#### Q3. Identify the top 3 suppliers with the largest positive change in received quantity by comparing their most recent delivery to their previous delivery, to understand suppliers with significant restocking trends.
SQL Subquery with Window Functions: Subquery, JOIN, LAG, ROW_NUMBER, RANK, ROUND, and filtering logic
